            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>Being appointed a marriage celebrant has fulfilled a life-long dream for me.</p>
            <p>I moved to Auckland 15 years ago and fell in love with Parnell where I still live and am heavily involved in the community.</p>
            <p>I work as an office manager for a busy professional practice in Newmarket.  I hail from the South Island where I had my own events management business so know all about organising events!</p>
            <p>I am from a large (and yes we were Catholic) family, am a mother of two adult children so appreciate the value of families and know all about family dynamics.</p>
            <p>Being raised a Catholic, I know all about pomp and ceremony!</p>
            <p>I have excellent written and verbal skills and hold a Certificate in Freelance Journalism from the New Zealand Institute of Business Studies.</p>
            <p>I am presently in the process of completing my Certificate in Celebrant Studies at The Celebrant School.  This training ensures you are in good hands.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are keeping fit (I’m a gym junkie), reading, current affairs (and a newspaper junkie!) and politics.</p>
